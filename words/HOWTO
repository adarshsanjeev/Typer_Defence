# How to run the parser
  * First run parse.py and give it the input. This will output the words files.
  * Then copy default.js from the source and run attach.py. This should attach the words to the 
	bottom of it.
  * MANUALLY LOOK OVER IT for any errors before copying it back and replacing the old version.
